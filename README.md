## Introduction

This repository is a collection of Java programs, examples, and exercises that I have worked on to prepare for the Java SE OCA exam. Each piece of code is intended to cover different aspects of the Java SE OCA exam objectives, helping to reinforce key concepts and provide practical experience.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories and files:

- `DemoPracticalProjects/`: Contains example programs that demonstrate specific concepts.
- `docs/`: Contains additional documentation and resources.
- `src/`: Contains all the Java source files organized by topics or chapters.

Example structure:

Java-SE-OCA-30/
├── DemoPracticalProjects/
│ ├── myGames/
│ ├── myUtils/
│ └── ...
├── docs/
└── src/
